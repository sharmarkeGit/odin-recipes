    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a dish my grandparents used to make. It is so simple, yet it is so yummy! It is great in the summer and even 
        better with homegrown zucchini.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1Â½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 large zucchini, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
